        <h1>Javascript Basics</h1>
        <p>Javascript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting lanugage. Javascript is extremely popular for a varity of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexiblility for developers to take it in  a bunch of different directions. Javascript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or node server) it can be connected to the objects of the environments to provide progromatic control over them.  </p>

        <ul>
           <li> </p><a href="#">Variable Deloration</a>Javascript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All Javascript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <span>var x;</span> </p>
           </li>
        


            <li><p><a href="#">Variable Assignment</a>Assignment operators assign values to Javascript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured into it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span> var x = 10;</span></p></li>

        
            <li><p><a href="#">Data Types</a> Data types are an improtant concept; to be able to operate on varaibles you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boulean - <span>true</span> or <span>false;</span> null - <span>null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span>42</span> or <span>3.14159;</span> String - <span>"Coding Dojo Rocks!"</span> Array - <span>[1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo']</span> and Object - <span>{first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</span> </li>
            
            <li><p><a href="#">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <span>if</span> a specificed condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span>else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span>else</span> we execute this block of code;</p></li>
        
            <li><p><a href="#">Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you ahve to run a mile, well you runa round the track four times and then you stop. That's a loop! </p> </li>
        
            <li><p><a href="#">Function</a> FunctionsThere are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you ahve to run a mile, well you runa round the track four times and then you stop. That's a loop! </p></li>
